### week 2: w02_hamiltonian_generative_networks.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13789

Summary: You can draw paralells between generative networks and the Hamiltonian.

Empirical uses and problems solved: You can use them as modified normalizing flow with some benefits.


### week 3: w03_thermodynamic_variational_objective.pdf.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00031

Summary: You can generalize the ELBO by drawing from thermodynamics.

Empirical uses and problems solved: Better performance in some situations when using the extensions.

### week 4: w04_tighter_variational_bounds_are_not_necessarily_better.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04537

Summary: Theoretical and empirical proof that tighter variational bounds can result in worse performance.

### week 9: w09_wasserstein_autoencoders.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01558

Summary: Autoencoder extension that brings the magic of Wasserstein optimization.

Empirical uses and problems solved: Arguably, much better theoretical justification than VAEs. Better opimization.

### week 12: w12_variational_to_deterministic_autoencoders.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12436

Summary: Regularize your AEs, don't use VAEs.

Empirical uses and problems solved: RAEs are as good as VAEs, but without alot of the bad aspects (posterior collapse).
