# generative-reading-group
The notes for a generative reading group I partake in. All notes in the folder "Sun" are written by me; other folders are titled by the nickname of the person who wrote them.

The notes are seperated by who presented them; each folder has a readme detailing what each PDF contains, a summary of empirical uses, and problems solved by the paper. 

The notes are designed around intuition, but do not neglect math.

The reading group is every monday, GMT+0 1AM, discord.sg/ai
