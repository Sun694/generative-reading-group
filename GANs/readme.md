### week 9: bun_w09_wasserstein_gan.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875

Summary: You can tie Wasserstein magic into GANs

Empirical uses: More stable training, more representative loss

### week 7: michael_w07_gan_recommendation.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10613

Summary: Learn unknown/hidden reward functions using a GAN

Empirical uses: Recommendation system which takes into account context (view history) and attempts to maximise the user's utility.

### week 15: sun684_w15_style_gan.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948

Summary: StyleGAN: A style-based GAN that uses clever tricks to make the generator better.

Empirical uses: If you want a good GAN, this is your best bet aside from StyleGAN2 (May 2020)

### week 16: sun_w16_style_gan2.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958

Summary: Better StyleGAN NOTE: There are typos in this PDF, however, my LaTeX document corrupted itself, so I cannot fix them.

Empirical uses: Better StyleGAN
