### week 2: anokhi_w02_hamiltonian_generative_networks.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13789

Summary: You can draw paralells between generative networks and the Hamiltonian.

Empirical uses: You can use them as modified normalizing flow with some benefits.

### week 9: bun_w09_wasserstein_gan.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875

Summary: You can tie Wasserstein magic into GANs

Empirical uses: More stable training, more representative loss

### week 7: michael_w07_gan_recommendation.pdf: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10613

Summary: Learn unknown/hidden reward functions using a GAN

Empirical uses: Recommendation system which takes into account context (view history) and attempts to maximise the user's utility.
